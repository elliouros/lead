# Lead

An aspiring minimalist extensible modal text editor written in exclusively Lua
and making use of the minimum amount of libraries possible- currently, lcurses
and LuaFS.

Current start method is to do `luajit start.lua`. Hopefully I can figure out
how to compile this later and make execution not suck...
